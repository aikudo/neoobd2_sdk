 * @file aws_mqtt_obd2pid.c
 *
 * This sample application is based on the default 'aws_demos' sample application
 * provided with the Amazon FreeRTOS distribution for CC3220SF-Launchxl.
 *
 * After establishing connection to the AWS IoT broker, the sample creates the
 * following three tasks:
 *
 * 1) CAN TX Task: Per every loop, this tasks constructs a CAN2.0 message that is
 * transmitted to the Vehicle CAN bus via the OBDII diagnostics port the neoOBD2 PRO
 * is connected to. The PIDs requested originate from the list of PIDs configured
 * by the user in the 'aws_iot_config' file.
 *
 * 2) ISM Task: This task calls the Intrepid Security Module every loop, which allows
 * exchange of vehicle network data and other processor to processor commands between
 * the main data acquisition processor and the CC320SF application processor. It is
 * critical for this task to be free from any delay (i.e: no vTaskDelay allowed in
 * the while(1) loop).
 *
 * 3) MQTT Publish Task: This task publishes the array of 132bytes of data containing
 * all 32 OBDII PID values to the connected AWS IoT broker. The topic to which the
 * data is published to is 'obd2pro/pids'
 *
